# Overview

This project analyzes the DEM and calculates the intersection of a slope greater than 5% and an aspect between 150 and 210 degrees. Displaying processed data on hillshade and trails

The purpose of the project is to find which trails are dangerous during the winter.

# Data Analysis Results

This program can analyse any given area and show the result, showing dangerous trails on the area.

# Development Environment

- gdal
- python
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

- Customize colors and transparency of the bitmaps
- Customize slope and aspect values
- Make vector calculation optional and show only result of slope and aspect intersection
